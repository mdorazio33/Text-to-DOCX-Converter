# Text-to-DOCX-Converter

This repository contains Python code for a Text to DOCX converter that I created. It is used to extract text from PDFs, Image-Only PDFs, and Website URLs.
I created this tool to primarily allow for quick and easy text extraction from a variety of sources into Word Documents for reporting and writing purposes.

I primarily used spaCy, OpenCV, PyMuPDF, and EasyOCR, along wiht a handful of other Python libraries to accomplish this. Please be sure to download the libraries necessary libraries shown in the "Importing the Necessary Libraries" portion of the demo
notebooks.
